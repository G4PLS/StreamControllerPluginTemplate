This template will go over the basics of creating Actions. This is done in a Lecture style.
Meaning that every Lecture expands on things that were used before.

In every Action there will be an explanation on the Functions used and what will be done in the Action itself.

Every Function will also have an explanation what will happen inside 
and there will be comments what most of the lines do.
